---

Your coding agent already reads code, writes code, and runs experiments. Scrinium adds a structured research workspace on top, so the same agent can search literature, cross-check results against papers, use scientific software more accurately, and carry the whole research workflow from one terminal.

- Your paper library becomes a reusable knowledge base for the same agent.
- When scientific software questions come up, the agent can consult official documentation at runtime instead of guessing from prompts.
- The system is built to keep expanding as new tools and workflows become worth supporting.

Scrinium offers more than search. It gives an AI coding agent a research workspace that supports natural-language interaction, papers and notes, more reliable use of scientific software, writing and running code, checking results against the literature, and structured academic writing.

## Quick Start

The default and recommended way to use Scrinium is simple: install it, configure it once, and open this repository directly with your coding agent.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wszqkzqk/scrinium.git
cd scrinium
pip install -e ".[full]"
scrinium setup
```

Then open the repository in Codex, Claude Code, or another supported agent. In this setup, the agent gets the fullest experience: bundled instructions, local skills, the CLI, and the complete codebase context are all available directly. For Claude Code plugins, Codex/OpenClaw skill registration, and other setup paths, see [`docs/getting-started/agent-setup.md`](docs/getting-started/agent-setup.md).

## What It Does

|  | Feature | Details |
|--|---------|---------|
| **PDF Parsing** | Deep structure extraction | Convert PDFs into structured Markdown while preserving formulas, figures, and layout as much as possible |
| **Not Just Papers** | More than papers | Journal articles, theses, patents, technical reports, standards, and lecture notes — five inbox categories with tailored metadata handling |
| **Hybrid Search** | Keyword + semantic fusion | Combine full-text and vector retrieval for stronger search results |
| **Curated Tags** | Agent-maintained topics | A controlled tag vocabulary curated by the agent (`data/tags.yaml`), indexed into search and filterable via `--tag` — replaces semantic discovery in embedding-free deployments |
| **Topic Discovery** | See what your library is about | Automatically group papers into research themes and use interactive views to grasp the overall structure quickly |
| **Literature Exploration** | Multi-dimensional discovery | Explore a research direction through journal, topic, author, institution, keyword, year, citation impact, and more |
| **Citation Graph** | References & impact | Forward citations, backward citations, and shared-reference analysis |
| **Layered Reading** | Read on demand | Start with metadata or the abstract, then move into conclusions or full text only when you need to |
| **Multi-Source Import** | Connect your existing library | Import directly from reference managers, PDFs, and Markdown without rebuilding your library from scratch |
| **Workspaces** | Organize by project | Manage paper subsets with scoped search and BibTeX export |
| **Multi-Format Export** | BibTeX, RIS, Markdown, DOCX | Export your full library or a workspace for Zotero, Endnote, submission, or sharing |
| **Persistent Notes** | Cross-session memory | Keep analysis notes for each paper so future sessions can reuse them instead of starting over |
| **Research Insights** | Reading behavior analytics | Search hot keywords, most-read papers, reading trends, and semantic neighbor recommendations for papers you haven't read yet |
| **Federated Discovery** | Cross-library search | Search your main library, exploration libraries, and arXiv from one entry point instead of hopping across tools |
| **AI-for-Science Runtime** | Use scientific software more accurately | Use scientific software against official documentation at runtime instead of guessing commands and parameters |
| **Extensible Tool Onboarding** | Keep adding the tools that matter | As new scientific tools and workflows become important, the system can keep expanding |
| **Academic Writing** | AI-assisted writing | Literature review, paper sections, citation check, rebuttal, and gap analysis — with every citation traceable to your own library |

## Works With Your Agent

Scrinium is designed to be **agent-agnostic**, but different agents expose different integration paths. Some work best when you open this repository directly; others are easier to use through plugins.

| Agent / IDE | Open this repo directly | Reuse from another project |
|-------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/skills/` | Claude plugin marketplace |
| [Codex](https://openai.com/codex) / OpenClaw | `AGENTS.md` + `.agents/skills/` | Symlink skills into `~/.agents/skills/` |
| [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) | `.clinerules` + `.claude/skills/` | CLI + skills |
| [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) | `.cursorrules` | CLI + skills |
| [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf) | `.windsurfrules` | CLI + skills |
| [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | CLI + skills |
| [Qwen Code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code) | `QWEN.md` | CLI + skills |

Skills follow the open [AgentSkills.io](https://agentskills.io) standard, and `.agents/skills/` is a symlink to `.claude/skills/` so different agents can discover and reuse the same skills.

**Migrating from existing tools?** Import directly from Endnote (XML/RIS) and Zotero (Web API or local SQLite), with PDFs, metadata, and references brought over together. More import sources are on the roadmap.

## Configuration

> Start by opening `scrinium` with your agent and let it walk you through the setup. The notes below are only a basic overview.

Scrinium works with a minimal setup and can be expanded as needed.

- `scrinium setup` walks you through the basics.
- An LLM API key is optional but recommended for more robust metadata extraction and content completion.
- A MinerU token is optional but recommended, and free. You can also deploy MinerU or Docling locally for PDF parsing.
- `scrinium setup check` shows what is installed, what is optional, and what is missing.

Full setup and configuration details → [`docs/getting-started/agent-setup.md`](docs/getting-started/agent-setup.md), [`config.yaml`](config.yaml)

## Agent First, CLI Available

Scrinium works best through an AI coding agent, but it also provides a CLI for scripting, debugging, and quick queries. For a current command reference aligned with the code, see [`docs/guide/cli-reference.md`](docs/guide/cli-reference.md).
